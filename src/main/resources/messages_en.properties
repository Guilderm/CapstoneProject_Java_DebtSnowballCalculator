homepage.paragraphtwo=So why in the world are we talking about snowballs? Because when you use this technique to pay off your debt, you will be debt-free in no time.
homepage.paragraphthree=The debt snowball method is a debt-reduction strategy where you pay off debt in order of smallest to largest, gaining momentum as you knock out each remaining balance.

homepage.paragraphfive=List your debts from smallest to largest regardless of interest rate.
homepage.paragraphsix=Attack the smallest debt and make minimum payments on all your debts.
